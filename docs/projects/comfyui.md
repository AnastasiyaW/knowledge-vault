## What it is

ComfyUI-H3VAE_TRT is a third-party ComfyUI extension by lihaoyun6. It compiles MiniMax-H3 VAE ONNX models into TensorRT engines and loads them as a VAE. This is a custom-node integration, not a release of the MiniMax-H3 model or a core ComfyUI update.

## Development line

- **2023-11-24 — ComfyUI Publishes Stable Video Diffusion Workflows.** On 2023-11-24, ComfyUI published first-party Stable Video Diffusion example workflows for image-to-video generation. The examples documented model placement and controls for frame count, motion, frame rate, and classifier-free guidance.
- **2024-06-12 — ComfyUI Core Adds SD3 Support.** On 2024-06-12, ComfyUI added SD3 support to its core engine in commit 8c4a9be. The change established native engine support for building SD3 workflows.
- **2024-09-16 — ComfyUI Adds SD3 and Flux Inpainting ControlNet Support.** On 2024-09-16, ComfyUI added support for AliMama ControlNet models for SD3 and Flux inpainting in commit f48e390. The change expanded structurally conditioned inpainting workflows for those model families.
- **2024-10-21 — ComfyUI V1 Introduces a New Interface and Desktop Beta.** On 2024-10-21, ComfyUI introduced its V1 interface and opened closed-beta Desktop packaging. The release added a bundled Manager, tabs, settings, model and workflow browsers, and model-download assistance. The original interface moved to a maintenance path.
- **2024-12-06 — ComfyUI Responds to the Ultralytics Package Compromise.** On 2024-12-06, ComfyUI documented its response to malicious Ultralytics 8.3.41 and 8.3.42 packages encountered through some custom-node dependency chains. The project distinguished the compromised dependency from ComfyUI core and added Manager warnings and version pinning.
- **2025-07-28 — ComfyUI Adds Day-Zero Wan 2.2 Support.** On 2025-07-28, ComfyUI added native day-zero support for Wan 2.2. The release provided official mixture-of-experts text-to-video and image-to-video workflows and packaged model files.
- **2025-08-13 — ComfyUI Expands Wan 2.2 Fun InP and Control Workflows.** On 2025-08-13, ComfyUI added Wan 2.2 Fun InP, Control, and LightX2V support. The workflows enabled first-and-last-frame generation, structural controls, and faster four-step generation with LoRA acceleration.
- **2025-08-26 — ComfyUI Adds Native Qwen-Image DiffSynth ControlNet Support.** On 2025-08-26, ComfyUI added native Qwen-Image DiffSynth ControlNet support. The update expanded controllable image generation and documented optional cache-based workflow acceleration.
- **2025-08-27 — ComfyUI Adds Hosted Gemini and Local Qwen-Image Control Paths.** On 2025-08-27, ComfyUI added two distinct execution paths: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash Image through credit-billed Partner Nodes and local InstantX Qwen-Image Unified ControlNet workflows. The local workflows supported canny, depth, pose, and soft-edge controls.
- **2025-08-28 — Second Comfy Challenge Expands the Community Workflow Program.** On 2025-08-28, ComfyUI expanded its community showcase and workflow-learning program through the second Comfy Challenge. This was an ecosystem and education milestone rather than a core runtime release.
- **2025-09-24 — ComfyUI Adds Wan 2.2 Animate and Qwen Image Editing Workflows.** On 2025-09-24, ComfyUI added native workflows for Wan 2.2 Animate and Qwen-Image-Edit-2509. They supported performer-driven character animation and replacement as well as multi-image editing.
- **2025-10-07 — ComfyUI 0.3.63 Makes Subgraphs Publishable.** On 2025-10-07, ComfyUI 0.3.63 made subgraphs publishable as reusable blueprint nodes. The release also redesigned selection tooling for graph editing.
- **2025-10-09 — ComfyUI Adds Sora 2 Partner Nodes.** On 2025-10-09, ComfyUI made Sora 2 and Sora 2 Pro available through paid Partner Nodes. The integration supported text-to-video and image-to-video generation with sound.
- **2025-10-22 — ComfyUI 0.3.66 Improves Subgraph and Template Tooling.** On 2025-10-22, ComfyUI 0.3.66 added a parameter panel for subgraphs. The release also redesigned workflow-template discovery and filtering.
- **2025-11-26 — Comfy Cloud Expands Infrastructure and Feature Allowances.** On 2025-11-26, Comfy Cloud announced a move to RTX 6000 Pro infrastructure and support for using personal LoRAs. It also described longer Pro runs and unified credits across Cloud GPU execution and Partner Nodes.
- **2025-12-30 — ComfyUI Begins Moving Its Canonical Repository to Comfy-Org.** On 2025-12-30, ComfyUI began moving its canonical GitHub repository from comfyanonymous/ComfyUI to Comfy-Org/ComfyUI. GitHub redirects were retained, and users were advised to update their Git remotes.
- **2026-01-27 — ComfyUI Adds Day-Zero Z-Image Support.** On 2026-01-27, ComfyUI added day-zero support for the non-distilled Z-Image model. The release included an official workflow and model-specific sampling guidance.
- **2026-02-05 — ComfyUI Ecosystem Announces an Open-Model Grant Initiative.** On 2026-02-05, the ComfyUI ecosystem announced an open-model grant initiative described as a $1 million program alongside the Anima launch. The initiative was presented as funding for open model development.
- **2026-03-26 — ComfyUI Introduces Stable Dynamic VRAM Management.** On 2026-03-26, ComfyUI documented Dynamic VRAM as a stable mechanism for reducing memory pressure and out-of-memory failures on supported Nvidia systems. Its guidance emphasized measuring total workflow time instead of isolated iteration speed.
- **2026-09-02 — Launch of ComfyUI H3VAE TensorRT integration.** The maintainer announced a TensorRT MiniMax-H3 VAE version for ComfyUI that can increase speed up to 1.7x.
  - The extension provides separate Compiler and Loader nodes. The checked source revision is 1b72e7439e1fc306b9dfbfd3d485866553b5960e, committed later on September 2; the original announcement did not identify a release tag. (2026-09-02) — <https://github.com/lihaoyun6/ComfyUI-H3VAE_TRT/blob/1b72e7439e1fc306b9dfbfd3d485866553b5960e/README.md>
- **2026-09-03 — ComfyUI update.** An independent tester reported 48.8s versus 36.6s for the same 2.0MP, six-second VAE decode on an RTX 4090 with 24GB, ComfyUI 0.34.2 and TensorRT 10.12. At 768p the result was 19.6s versus 18.0s. This is one workload-specific decode test, not an overall generation-speed claim.

## What changed

The maintainer reports up to 1.7x faster MiniMax-H3 VAE processing in a third-party ComfyUI integration. The claim concerns VAE encode/decode, not end-to-end video generation. The source announcement date is retained separately from the subsequent research.

## How to use this

1. Clone the extension into ComfyUI/custom_nodes and install its requirements using the Python environment that runs ComfyUI.

2. Download the encoder and decoder ONNX files from the maintainer's linked model repository, including accompanying .data files when supplied. Put them under ComfyUI/models/vae.

3. Build the engines with MiniMax-H3 TRT VAE Compiler, then load them with MiniMax-H3 TRT VAE Loader.

## Best practices

- Below 12GB VRAM, the maintainer suggests the w4a16_awq decoder. Treat this as an author recommendation, not a guarantee that the complete video workflow will fit your GPU.
  — <https://github.com/lihaoyun6/ComfyUI-H3VAE_TRT/blob/1b72e7439e1fc306b9dfbfd3d485866553b5960e/README_zh.md>
- Compare the same latent at your target resolution and measure VAE decode separately from total generation time. The independent test found a much smaller gain at 768p than at 2.0MP.

## Superseded by this

- Nothing marked obsolete yet.

## Still unknown

- The original announcement does not identify an immutable release tag or the installed version.
- The maintainer's maximum 1.7x claim is not an independent benchmark of complete video generation.
- A Chinese community guide was located, but its page could not be retrieved in the root verification pass. Chinese coverage here is first-party documentation; no independent Chinese benchmark is claimed.
- No workflow was executed on our GPU for this article. Hardware measurements are attributed to their authors.
